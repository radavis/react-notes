## `react-router`

Clicking a `<Link to={pathName}>` component renders the children of the
`<Route path={pathName}>` component.

> As you click around on the different `<Link>`s, the router renders the
> matching `<Route>`. [...] Behind the scenes a `<Link>` renders an `<a>` with
> a real href, so people using the keyboard for navigation or screen readers
> will still be able to use this app.
